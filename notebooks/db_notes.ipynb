    "1. There are probably at least 2 tables that describe order. As well, this is suggested by the column \"Sequence\" in the original AviList 2025 Excel sheet. It could be described with tables Checklist(avibase_id, checklist_name, checklist_version, ..) -- e.g. checklist_name \"AviList\", version \"2025\"; and Sequence(checklist_id, avibase_id, seq_num, ..) -- where avibase_id is a taxon concept of a specific conscription found in, say, AviList 2025.\n",
    "2. As suggested by the rubric/algorithm of inclusion, there are a number of things that are not self-descriptive about the database schema. There are likely a large number of rules in an application that populates the data that make the data work. The highly normalized structure means, when creating a \"row\" of, say, a new species, would require careful placement of a single avibaseID across several tables, across a number of dimensions of description. From this normalization, it's not quite clear, beyond reference to article literature, what makes for the conscription of the species. Perhaps other structures exist not described in the paper that do this -- though, it does seem to be extrinsic to, perhaps a precondition of, the data."
