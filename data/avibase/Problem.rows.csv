Although archboldi and salvadorii are sometimes split as species separate from A. albertisi (Cleere 2010; Dickinson & Remsen 2013), but based on mitochondrial DNA evidence relationships are shallow and remain poorly resolved (Dumbacher et al. 2003). Furthermore, archboldi and salvadorii are not maintained as subspecies, since the information on vocalizations of each taxon are uncertain, known phenotypic differences are minimal, and plumage is often quite variable even within a subspecific taxon within Aegotheles."

(2010); this placement was supported by Zhao et al. (2025) based on mitogenomic data.
